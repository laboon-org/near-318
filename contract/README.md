# Near-318: Smart Contract

- This app was initialized with [create-near-app]
- With NextJS-v12

## Prerequisites

```sh
    node v16.18.1
    npm v8.19.2
```
## Getting Start

If you haven't installed yarn, then run:

    npm install --global yarn

Install dependencies:

    yarn

Build and deploy your contract to TestNet with a temporary dev account:

    yarn deploy


Deploy
======

Every smart contract in NEAR has its [own associated account][NEAR accounts].
When you run `yarn deploy`, your smart contract gets deployed to the live NEAR TestNet with a temporary dev account.
When you're ready to make it permanent, here's how:


Step 0: Install near-cli (optional)
-------------------------------------

[near-cli] is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. It was installed to the local `node_modules` folder when you ran `yarn`, but for best ergonomics you may want to install it globally:

    npm install --global near-cli

Or, if you'd rather use the locally-installed version, you can prefix all `near` commands with `npx`

Ensure that it's installed with `near --version` (or `npx near --version`)


Step 1: Create an account for the contract
------------------------------------------

Each account on NEAR can have at most one contract deployed to it. If you've already created an account such as `your-name.testnet`, you can deploy your contract to `near-project.your-name.testnet`. Assuming you've already created an account on [NEAR Wallet], here's how to create `near-project.your-name.testnet`:

1. Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:

      near login

2. Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):

      near create-account near-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet

Step 2: deploy the contract
---------------------------

Use the CLI to deploy the contract to TestNet with your account ID.
Replace `PATH_TO_WASM_FILE` with the `wasm` that was generated in `contract` build directory.

    near deploy --accountId near-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet --wasmFile PATH_TO_WASM_FILE


Step 3: set contract name in your frontend code
-----------------------------------------------

Modify the line in `src/config.js` that sets the account name of the contract. Set it to the account id you used above.

    const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'near-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet'



Troubleshooting
===============

On Windows, if you're seeing an error containing `EPERM` it may be related to spaces in your path. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/zkat/npx/issues/209) for more details.
